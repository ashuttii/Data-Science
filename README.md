The above link contains all supporting files. Below are the folder descriptions,

1.	**ESG Data** – All Data used for the research – Bloomberg, Refinitiv, DataWorld


2.	**ESG Code** – Files and folders are,

    Estimating ESG for SME - SourceCode (Analysis&Training).ipynb - For ease of access, the file contains all the code that was combined from all dataset training and analysis, model creation, and transfer learning. All the trials (success and failed are placed in All Trial Folder) 
    

    Testing - ModelTestingWithUnseenData.ipynb – For Model testing
    

    All Trial Folder – All the code the developer worked on from the start of the project
    

3.	**ESG Objects** - Saved Models and saved objects like encoder and scalars


4.	**ESG Train-TestData** – Unprocessed Test set and Processed training data

### Testing Models - in Google Colab

-->	Test file located in folder Estimating ESG for **SMEs -> ESG Code -> Testing - ModelTestingWithUnseenData.ipynb**.
This is a Google Colab file that can be run from any system.

-->	Update Google Drive Location if placing it in different location

-->	Run lines of code in sequence -> The code will read unprocessed test data, and the functions will process the test data and predict the values.
